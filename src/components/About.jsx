      <p>I am Harsh Khatri, currently pursuing B-tech from Bhilai Institute Of Technology, Durg(C.G.) (2020-24). My programming journey starts at school, in class 11th I opted for a Computer science subject and I learnt C++ there. This introduction to programming led me to pursue this career. In my second year of college, my team got selected for the finals of Smart India Hackathon 2022. It is a national-level competition organized by the government of India to promote innovation and entrepreneurship. We chose a problem statement and found a solution. This experience taught me so much about problem-solving, critical thinking, teamwork, innovation etc.</p>

      <br />

      <p>Apart from that, one of my greatest experiences is being a part of the top 1% NCC(National Cadet Corps) cadet by being selected for Republic Day Camp 2022, Delhi and feel honoured to salute the Prime Minister of India. I had the opportunity to participate in various activities that helped me develop my leadership, teamwork, and communication skills. I am perseverant and always receptive to new ideas and perspectives, and willing to learn from others. </p>
